# Tabbed Select Rendering Dialog
When a placeholder has settings that allow for a large list fo renderings, the dialog can get quite cluttered and a little overwhelming for a content author.

This will gather the list of available renderings and group them by parent item. Then each parent item group, will get a tab to show the normal rendering select dialog. This just helps break the renderings into some organizable list.

This has been tested in Sitecore 7.1 (rev. 140130) and 8.1 (rev. 160302), but I imagine it would work in most versions of Sitecore since the dialog didn't seem to change at all between 7.1 and 8.1.
